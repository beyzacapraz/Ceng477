Three-dimensional viewing: Viewing pipeline, viewing parameters, projections, viewing transformations, clipping. Visible surface detection. Introduction to illumination models and surface rendering.

# Homework 1
Ray tracing is a fundamental rendering algorithm. It is commonly used for animations and architectural simulations, in which the quality of the created images is more important than the time
it takes to create them. In this assignment, I am going to implement a basic ray tracer that
simulates the propagation of light in real world.
